- Draw 5 people and place them in the yard
- Give each player a deck consisting of:
  - 5x "Buddy" inmate cards
  - 4x "Cigg" contraband
  - 1x "Half a pack" contraband

# The game
After a failed bank robbery, you and your buddies have just been sent to the slammer. 
The rumors are, there will be a prison riot soon, and everyone knows: fresh meat equals dead meat in a riot. 
The only way to survive is to be important, so start working for it - be the boss by the time the riot starts! 
 
# How to win
The winner of the game is the inmate to first be the boss of the prison block.
To be boss, you need a reputation! The amoun of reputation needed depends on how many players there are:

| Number of players | Repution needed | 
| ------------------ | ---------------- |
| 2 | 50 | 
| 3 | 45 | 
| 4 | 40 | 
| 5 | 35 | 

You get a reputation by running errands for other inmates, ratting them out to the guards, beating them up and generally being a total dirtbag.
When a player has earned the required reputation to win, that player finishes his turn, then all other players get one more turn each. 

Whoever has the highest reputation at the end of the game wins. 

## The factions
The jail has several factions and you have to play them against each other, or join them if you want to stand a chance.
The factions are: The Blacks, The White Supremacists, The Latinos and The Asian. 


# Game areas

## The cells
Each player has a cell. This is where you keep your ciggs, your partially assembled weapons and your current errands. 
The cell area also contains your deck and your spent piles.

## The yard
The yard is the main area of the table. The yard consists of 5 (always) people, pluss whoever is fighting, along with the weapons they are using.
 
## Card piles

### Deck & Spent piles
Each player has a deck and a spent pile. Cards are drawn from the deck and used cards are put in the spent pile at the end of turn.

When a deck runs out of cards (i.e. a player is asked to draw a crad, but there are no more cards in his deck), shuffle that players spent pile and use it as the new deck.

### Contraband & Sold
Contraband is drawn from the contraband pile. When sold, put the sold contraband in the sold pile.

If the contraband pile ever runs out, shuffle the sold pile and use it as a new contraband pile.

### Favours & Done
Favours is drawn from the _favours pile_. When played, put the favour card in the _favours done pile_.

If the _favours pile_ ever runs out, shuffle the _favours done pile_ and use it as a new _favours pile_.


# Your turn
During your turn, you may do any or all of the following as many times as you like:

- Search the yard

OR

- Sell contraband
- Play favours
- Assemble items
- Run errand
- Go to the Yard
 
When your turn is over, put all cards in your hand in your spent pile and draw 5 new cards. 
If, at any point, you are asked to draw a card and your deck is empty, shuffle your current spent pile. This is now your deck.

## Searching the yard
If you choose to search the yard, this is your ONLY legal action this turn. 

To search the yard:

- put your hand in the spent pile
- draw 2 contraband and put them in the spent pile.

## Selling contraband
All contraband cards have a value in ciggs (even the cigarette cars - playing one of these represent you finding/being given cigarettes).
When you sell contraband you take its value in ciggs and place it in your cell. Then the contraband in the _sold pile_.

## Play favours
If you have any favours, you may play them at any time (including other players' turns). 
Follow the rule-text, then place the favour in the _favours done pile_. 


## Assemble items
Some contraband have the _Plan_ type. These cards are plans for making powerful weapons and other items that will help you out greatly.
When you play a plan card, place in in your cell. The items themselves have their own cards, placed in the _items_ pile. 

A plan has a list of ingredients needed for assembly. I.E: _1 Sharp Edge, 1 Wrapping_.  
During your turn, you may take cards from your hand, matching the ingredients for a plan, and place them on the plan card. 
These cards are not removed at the end of your turn, so you can use several turns to assemble an item. 

Once all ingredients have been placed on a plan, remove the plan and all the ingredients from the game, then take the item card and put it into your _hand_.

### Weapons
A lot of the assembled items are weapons. A weapon may be wielded by an inmate during a fight. 
An inmate wielding a weapon is considered _armed_, while an inmate with no weapon is considered _unarmed_.

To equip an inmate with a weapon, play the weapon and state which inmate is wielding it.  

Equipping a weapon is free, but each inmate can only wield one weapon at a time unless otherwise stated on the cards.  

## Running errands
Some favours (called "big favours") require an errand. The errand cards are special favour cards that work much in the 
same way as the _plan_ cards. To play an errand, place it in your cell. Whenever you do one of the required tasks of an errands, 
mark it as completed by putting a counter on the card, etc. 

Once all tasks are completed, remove the errand card from the game, take the "big favour" card and put it into your hand.

## Go to the yard
In the yard is where you meet all the other denizens of the prison - the Inmates and the Guards. 
There should always be 5 people in the yard. Once one person is removed, replace it _immediately_ buy drawing a new person from the people pile.
 
### Inmates
An inmate can be handled in 2 ways: buying them or beating them. 

#### Buying inmates
If an inmate has a price, you can buy him. 

To buy an inmate, pay his price in ciggs buy taking the required amount of ciggs from your cell. 
Once the price is paid, take the inmate card and put it in your spent pile.

Buying an inmate _does not_ trigger the _loot_ part of the inmate card.

#### Beating inmates
If you don't want an inmate as part of your crew, you may choose to beat him instead.

Beating inmates is the main way of earning a reputation, along with popularity with the various factions of the prison.
 
To beat an inmate (called "the target") you do the following:
- Play an inmate from your hand by paying an amount of ciggs equal to his _rank_.
- You and other players may play cards to affect the outcome of the fight. I.e. equip weapons, play favours, etc.
- Once all players are done playing cards, if your inmate's power is _greater_ than the target's power, the target is beaten. 
  
*If the target was beaten:*

  - Increase your _reputation_ by the target's rank
  - Increase your popularity with you inmate's rank by *1*
  - Handle the _loot_ portion of the beaten inmate's card
  - Put the beaten inmate card in the _beaten pile_

*After the fight is over:*
  
- Decrease your popularity with the target's faction by *2*
- Put all played cards in their owners' spent piles

### Guards 
Guards cannot be beating, so you will have to pay them off!

All guards have different demands. To handle a guard, pay the cost stated on the card.
Once a guard has been payed off, put him in your spent pile.

Guards are played in the same way as favours.

*Framing an inmate*
Most guards require you to frame an inmate as part of the cost of handling the guard. 
To frame an inmate, take an inmate card from your hand and put it in the _beaten pile_ (_Buddy_ cards are removed from the game instead).

*Note:* _This is one of the few ways of removing unwanted inmates from your deck, use it wisely!_
