# King of the Cell Block

## Quick start
- Put 5 ciggs in each cell
- Draw 5 people and place them in the yard
- Give each player a deck consisting of:
-- 5x "Buddy" inmate cards
-- 4x "Cigg" contraband
-- 1x "Half a pack" contraband

## Playing the game

## How to win
The winner of the game is the inmate to first be the boss of the prison block.
To be boss, you need a reputation! How high a reputation you need depends on how many inmates there are:

| Number of Inmates  | Repuation needed | 
|--------------------|------------------|
| 2 | 50 | 
| 3 | 45 | 
| 4 | 40 | 
| 5 | 35 | 

You get a reputation by running errands for other inmates, ratting them out to the guards, beating them up and generally being total dirtbag.   


## Setting up

### The cells
Each player has a cell. This is where you keep your ciggs and your partially assembled weapons. 
The cell area also contains your deck and your spent piles.

### The yard
The yard is the main area of the table. The yard consists of 5 (always) people, pluss whoever is fighting, along with the weapons they are using. 

## Your turn
During your turn, you may do any or all of the following as many times as you like:
- Sell contraband
- Play favours
- Assemble items
- Run errand
- Go to the Yard
 
When your turn is over, put all cards in your hand in your spent pile and draw 5 new cards. 
If, at any point, you are asked to draw a card and your deck is empty, shuffle your current spent pile. This is now your deck. 

### Selling contraband
All contraband cards have a value in ciggs.
When you sell contraband you take its value in ciggs and place it in your cell. Then you place the contraband in your spent pile.

### Play favours
If you have any favours, you may play them at any time (including other players' turns). 
Follow the rule-text, then place the favour in your spent pile. 



### Assemble items
Some contraband have the _Plan_ type. These cards are plans for making powerful weapons and other items that will help you out greatly.
When you play a plan card, place in in your cell. The items themselves have their own cards, placed in the _items_ pile. 

A plan has a list of ingredients needed for assembly. I.E: _1 Sharp Edge, 1 Wrapping_.  
During your turn, you may take cards from your hand, matching the ingredients for a plan, and place them on the plan card. 
These cards are not removed at the end of your turn, so you can use several turns to assemble an item. 

Once all ingredients have been placed on a plan, remove the plan and all the ingredients from the game, then take the item card and put it into your _hand_.

### Running errands
Some favours (called "big favours") require an errand. The errand cards are special favour cards that work much in the 
same way as the _plan_ cards. To play an errand, place it in your cell. Whenever you do one of the required tasks of an errands, 
mark it as completed by putting a counter on the card, etc. 

Once all tasks are completed, remove the errand card from the game, take the "big favour" card and put it into your hand.
